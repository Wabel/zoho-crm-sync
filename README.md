Wabel's Zoho-CRM Synchronizer
=============================

Work in progress.

What is this?
-------------

This project is a set of tools to help you synchronize your database with
ZohoCRM records.
It is built on top of the [ZohoCRM ORM](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-orm).
Before reading further you should get used to working with [ZohoCRM ORM](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-orm),
so if you do not know this library, [STOP READING NOW and follow this link](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-orm).

How does it work?
-----------------

*Zoho-CRM Synchronizer* does not assume any database model in your application. You could be using Doctrine, PDO,
MySQL, PostgreSQL or store data into MongoDB, you can use *Zoho-CRM Synchronizer*. It also means that **you** will
be in charge of storing data into your database.

*Zoho-CRM Synchronizer* contains a `ZohoSynchronizer` class, with a `sync()` method that synchronizes your database
with Zoho (in both ways).

Each instance of `ZohoSynchronizer` can synchronize a Zoho module (for instance "Contacts", or "Accounts").
The `ZohoSynchronizer` constructor expects 2 parameters:

- The ZohoDao of the module (generated by the [ZohoCRM ORM library](https://github.com/Wabel/zoho-crm-orm))
- A **mapper** implementing the `MappingInterface`. It is up to **you** to write this mapper.

```php
use Wabel\Zoho\CRM\ZohoClient;
use Wabel\Zoho\CRM\Sync\ZohoSynchonizer;

// First we need to create the ContactZohoDao
$zohoClient = new ZohoClient($zohoAuthToken);
$contactZohoDao = new ContactZohoDao($zohoClient);

// Then we need to instantiate the mapper
$contactMapper = new MyContactMapper();

// Finally, we can call the synchronizer:
$synchronizer = new ZohoSynchonizer($contactZohoDao, $contactMapper);
$synchronizer->sync();
```

The `Synchronizer` class will be in charge of talking to Zoho and fetching the latest modified records.
Your **mapper** will be in charge of mapping those Zoho records to your database and vice-versa. 

A bit of vocabulary
-------------------

In the rest of this document, we will use 2 terms quite often:

- an **application bean** is an object you have in YOUR application and that represents a row in database.
  For instance, if you are using Doctrine, this would be an array of Doctrine entities. If you are using TDBM, this 
  would be an array of TDBM beans...
- a **Zoho bean** is an object representing a Zoho record. These objects are generated by the ZohoCRM ORM library. 

The goal of the mapper is to map fields between *application beans* and *Zoho beans*.

Writing a mapper
----------------

You must write a mapper for every kind of record you want to synchronize.

Your **mapper** must implement `Wabel\Zoho\CRM\Sync\MappingInterface`.
This interface provides these methods:

```php
use Wabel\Zoho\CRM\Sync\MappingInterface;

class MyContactMapper implements MappingInterface {
        /**
         * Returns an array of application beans that have been modified since the last synchronisation with Zoho.
         *
         * @return \object[]
         */
        public function getBeansToSynchronize()
        {
            // This method should return a list of beans representing your database rows.
            // For instance, if you are using Doctrine, this would be an array of Doctrine entities.
            // If you are using TDBM, this would be an array of TDBM beans...
        }


        /**
         * Returns a Zoho Bean based on the bean passed in argument
         *
         * @param  object            $applicationBean
         * @return ZohoBeanInterface
         */
        public function toZohoBean($applicationBean)
        {
            // The goal of this method is to create a new Zoho bean based on the application bean passed in parameter.
            // It should return a Zoho bean matching your bean.
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns a Zoho Bean based on the bean passed in argument
         *
         * @param  ZohoBeanInterface $zohoBean
         * @return object
         */
        public function toApplicationBean(ZohoBeanInterface $zohoBean)
        {
            // This method will receive the Zoho bean from Zoho.
            // It should
            // 1- get the ZohoId (using $zohoBean->getZohoId() )
            // 2- check in your database 
        }
    
        /**
         * Stores the ZohoID in the bean passed in parameter.
         *
         * @param object $applicationBean
         * @param string $zohoId
         */
        public function onSyncToZohoComplete($applicationBean, $zohoId, \DateTime $date)
        {
            if (!$applicationBean instanceof ContactApplicationBean) {
                throw new ZohoCRMException("Expected ContactApplicationBean");
            }
            $applicationBean->setZohoId($zohoId);
            $applicationBean->setZohoLastModificationDate($date);
        }
    
    
        /**
         * Filters the list of Zoho beans to store in database.
         *
         *
         * @param  array $zohoBeans
         * @return array The filtered list of Zoho beans.
         */
        public function filterZohoBeans(array $zohoBeans)
        {
            return $zohoBeans;
        }
    
        public function getLastZohoModificationDate() {
            $now = new \DateTime();
            return $now->sub(new \DateInterval("P1D"));
        }

}
```
